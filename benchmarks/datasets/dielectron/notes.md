Distinct electron interactions, the target I've chosen (arbitrarily) is to compute their mass, which (with my limited understanding of physics) should be inferable with a very small error given we know all those angles and the total energy produced + charges.

Not sure if this is real colider data or just simulations.

The CMS collaboration has approved the release of 100k dielectron events in the invariant mass range 2-110 GeV for use in outreach and education. This document contains the files for this release.

These data were selected for use in education and outreach and contain a subset of the total event information. The selection criteria may be different from that used in CMS physics results. They are not suitable for a full physics analysis.
