# CERN Electron Collision Data

# Context
This dataset contains 100k dielectron events in the invariant mass range 2-110 GeV for use in outreach and education. These data were selected for use in education and outreach and contain a subset of the total event information. The selection criteria may be different from that used in CMS physics results.

# Content
Target: Q1 or Q2
1) Run: The run number of the event.
2) Event: The event number.
3, 11) E1, E2: The total energy of the electron (GeV) for electrons 1 and 2.
4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 14) px1,py1,pz1,px2,py2,pz2: The components of the momemtum of the electron 1 and 2 (GeV).
7, 15) pt1, pt2: The transverse momentum of the electron 1 and 2 (GeV).
8, 16) eta1, eta2: The pseudorapidity of the electron 1 and 2.
9, 17) phi1, phi2: The phi angle of the electron 1 and 2 (rad).
10, 18) Q1, Q2: The charge of the electron 1 and 2.
19) M: The invariant mass of two electrons (GeV).
